## Codes
* `NeuroAnat_SexDiff/code` contains source codes
* `NeuroAnat_SexDiff/demo` contains .html files of the same codes (compiled and static presentation)

## Data and analysis
* Strucutral MRI of the [PNC study](http://www.med.upenn.edu/bbl/philadelphianeurodevelopmentalcohort.html ) were used for this study.  
* Morphological features of the strucutral images were derived using [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net) toolkit.  
* FreeSurfer analysis was performed using [LONI pipeline](http://pipeline.loni.usc.edu) on high performance computing of <font color='red'>**USC**</font> Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics [Institute](http://www.ini.usc.edu), Keck school of Medicine of <font color='red'>**USC**</font>. The outputs were QC'ed and used as the input of this notebook.
